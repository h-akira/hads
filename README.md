# HADS
## Overview
HADS (h-akira AWS Develop with Serverless) is a framework to develop serverless web applications on AWS.  
Although this framework is a successor to [HAD](https://github.com/h-akira/had), 
there are some cases where it is recommended to continue using HAD because the philosophy is very different.
## Philosophy
- Use SAM
- One Lambda
- Static files are distributed from S3
- Test Locally
- Like Django
## Usage
Comming soon...
## Development Schedule
The following features will be added ad later date:
- Authentication and authorization with Cognito
- Genarete SAM and other templates
- Authentication information registration function when using boto3 locally
